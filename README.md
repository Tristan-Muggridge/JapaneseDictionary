This application uses Python (BeautifulSoup4 & TKinter) to provide a Japanese-English dictionary for a user, allowing for the ability to search in either language, and receive results via web scraping Jisho.Org which does not feature an API.

Problem: Studying Japanese, there are many times when I find myself having to search within a dictionary to double-check word meanings and Kanji usages. This process has become rather tedious, perhaps more relevant however, is that I really want to try using TKinter

Tools:

    Tkinter: GUI library for the composition of the application user interface.
    BeautifulSoup4: WebScraping library for the harvesting of data from jisho.org since there's no REST API present.

    Local database which caches Jisho.Org data
